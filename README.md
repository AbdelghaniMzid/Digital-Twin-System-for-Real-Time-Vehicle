# ðŸš— Digital Twin System for Real-Time Vehicle Sensor Data Monitoring and Fault Detection

## Overview
This project is part of my **studies in Mechatronics**, focusing on the development of a **Digital Twin framework** for real-time vehicle data monitoring and fault detection. The system creates a synchronized connection between the **Digital Master**, which stores all vehicle data, and the **Digital Shadow**, which represents real-time data collected from the vehicle's sensors.

### Project Objectives:
- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Collect and monitor data from various vehicle sensors, including engine temperature, tire pressure, and speed.
- **Fault Detection and Notification**: Detect faulty sensors, missing data, or abnormal conditions, and automatically generate intelligent notifications using NLP, NLG, and NLU technologies.
- **Simulation of Vehicle Conditions**: Simulate critical conditions to enhance safety monitoring.
- **Database Integration**: Organize sensor data in a structured database for efficient querying and analysis.

## Features
- **Digital Master**: A storage system for all historical and current vehicle data, ensuring data consistency and availability.
- **Digital Shadow**: Simulates real-time data collected from the vehicle, continuously synchronized with the Digital Master.
- **Fault Detection**: The system automatically detects sensor malfunctions or abnormal conditions and generates notifications based on data analysis.
- **NLP/NLG/NLU for Notifications**: Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to create user-friendly and meaningful alerts.
- **Database Integration**: Data from sensors is structured in a database, making it easy to query and analyze for faults or anomalies.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§  
The project is still under development with a focus on:
- Building the communication between the Digital Master and Digital Shadows.
- Developing the notification system using NLP, NLG, and NLU technologies.
- Finalizing the backend and frontend structure for real-time monitoring.
